//Introduction to the Debugging Challenges
/* Debugging is the process of finding exactly what isn't working and fixing it. 
After spending time creating a brilliant block of code, it is tough realizing it 
may have errors. These issues generally come in three forms:

-syntax errors that prevent a program from running
-runtime errors when code fails to execute or has unexpected behavior
-semantic (or logical) errors when code doesn't do what it's meant to.

Modern code editors (and experience) can help identify syntax errors. 
Semantic and runtime errors are harder to find. They may cause your program to crash, 
make it run forever, or give incorrect output. Think of debugging as trying to 
understand why your code is behaving the way it is. 

Example of a syntax error -  often detected by the code editor: */
funtcion willNotWork( 
  console.log("Yuck");
}  // "function" keyword is misspelled and there's a missing parenthesis

//Here's an example of a runtime error - often detected while the program executes:
function loopy() {
  while(true) {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
  }
} // Calling loopy starts an infinite loop, which may crash your browser

//Example of a semantic error - often detected after testing code output:
function calcAreaOfRect(w, h) {
  return w + h; // This should be w * h
}
let myRectArea = calcAreaOfRect(2, 3);
// Correct syntax and the program executes, but this gives the wrong answer



/*The console.log() method, which "prints" the output of what's within its parentheses
to the console, will likely be the most helpful debugging tool. Placing it at strategic
points in your code can show you the intermediate values of variables. 
It's good practice to have an idea of what the output should be before looking at what it is.

Here's an example to print 'Hello world!' to the console: */

console.log('Hello world!');

//Another example
let a = 5;
let b = 1;
a++;
console.log(a); //returns 7

let sumAB = a + b;
console.log(sumAB);


//Use console.clear() to clear the browser console.

//Debugging: Use typeof to Check the Type of a Variable
/*You can use typeof to check the data structure, or type, of a variable. 
This is useful in debugging when working with multiple data types. If you think
 you're adding two numbers, but one is actually a string, the results can be unexpected.
  Type errors can lurk in calculations or function calls. Be careful especially when 
  you're accessing and working with external data in the form of a JavaScript Object 
  Notation (JSON) object.

Here are some examples using typeof:  */

console.log(typeof ""); // outputs "string"
console.log(typeof 0); // outputs "number"
console.log(typeof []); // outputs "object"
console.log(typeof {}); // outputs "object"
/* JavaScript recognizes six primitive (immutable) data types: Boolean, Null, 
Undefined, Number, String, and Symbol (new with ES6) and one type for mutable 
items: Object. Note that in JavaScript, arrays are technically a type of object.  */

let seven = 7;
let three = "3";
console.log(seven + three); //73
console.log(typeof seven); //number
console.log(typeof three); //string


//Debugging: Catch Misspelled Variable and Function Names
/* The console.log() and typeof methods are the two primary ways to check intermediate 
values and types of program output. Now it's time to get into the common forms that 
bugs take. One syntax-level issue that fast typers can commiserate with is the humble 
spelling error.

Transposed, missing, or mis-capitalized characters in a variable or function name 
will have the browser looking for an object that doesn't exist - and complain in the 
form of a reference error. JavaScript variable and function names are case-sensitive.  */


//Debugging: Catch Unclosed Parentheses, Brackets, Braces and Quotes
/* Another syntax error to be aware of is that all opening parentheses, brackets, 
curly braces, and quotes have a closing pair. Forgetting a piece tends to happen 
when you're editing existing code and inserting items with one of the pair types. 
Also, take care when nesting code blocks into others, such as adding a callback 
function as an argument to a method.

One way to avoid this mistake is as soon as the opening character is typed, 
immediately include the closing match, then move the cursor back between them
 and continue coding. Fortunately, most modern code editors generate the second
  half of the pair automatically.  */

/*The reduce() method reduces an array to a single value. If youâ€™re not familiar with it,
 the following code shows an example of using the the method:  */

const array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(array1.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue));  // expected output: 10

let myArray = [1, 2, 3];
let arraySum = myArray.reduce((previous, current) =>  previous + current);
console.log(`Sum of array values is: ${arraySum}`);  //"Sum of array values is: 6"


//Debugging: Catch Mixed Usage of Single and Double Quotes
/*JavaScript allows the use of both single (') and double (") quotes to declare a string.
 Deciding which one to use generally comes down to personal preference, with some exceptions.

Having two choices is great when a string has contractions or another piece of text that's 
in quotes. Just be careful that you don't close the string too early, which causes a syntax
 error.

Here are some examples of mixing quotes: */

// These are correct:
const grouchoContraction = "I've had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn't it.";
const quoteInString = "Groucho Marx once said 'Quote me as saying I was mis-quoted.'";

// This is incorrect:
const uhOhGroucho = 'I've had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn't it.';
//Of course, it is okay to use only one style of quotes. 
//You can escape the quotes inside the string by using the backslash (\) escape character:
// Correct use of same quotes:
const allSameQuotes = 'I\'ve had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn\'t it.';

//Another example
let innerHtml = "<p>Click here to <a href=\"#Home\">return home</a></p>";
console.log(innerHtml); //"<p>Click here to <a href=\"#Home\">return home</a></p>"


//Debugging: Catch Use of Assignment Operator Instead of Equality Operator
/* Branching programs, i.e. ones that do different things if certain conditions are met,
 rely on if, else if, and else statements in JavaScript. The condition sometimes takes 
 the form of testing whether a result is equal to a value.

This logic is spoken (in English, at least) as "if x equals y, then ..." which can 
literally translate into code using the =, or assignment operator. This leads to 
unexpected control flow in your program.

As covered in previous challenges, the assignment operator (=) in JavaScript assigns 
a value to a variable name. And the == and === operators check for equality 
(the triple === tests for strict equality, meaning both value and type are the same).

The code below assigns x to be 2, which evaluates as true. Almost every value on 
its own in JavaScript evaluates to true, except what are known as the "falsy" values:
 false, 0, "" (an empty string), NaN, undefined, and null. */

let x = 1;
let y = 2;
if (x = y) {  //assigns x to be 2, which evaluates as true.
  // this code block will run for any value of y (unless y were originally set as a falsy)
} else {
  // this code block is what should run (but won't) in this example
}

//example 
let x = 7;
let y = 9;
let result = "to come";

if(x == y) { //the == and === operators check for equality
  result = "Equal!";
} else {
  result = "Not equal!";
}

console.log(result); //"Not equal!"



//Debugging: Catch Missing Open and Closing Parenthesis After a Function Call
/* When a function or method doesn't take any arguments, you may forget to include
 the (empty) opening and closing parentheses when calling it. Often times the result 
 of a function call is saved in a variable for other use in your code. This error can 
 be detected by logging variable values (or their types) to the console and seeing 
 that one is set to a function reference, instead of the expected value the function
  returns.

The variables in the following example are different:  */

function myFunction() {
  return "You rock!";
}
let varOne = myFunction; // set to equal a function
let varTwo = myFunction(); // set to equal the string "You rock!"

//Another example
function getNine() {
    let x = 6;
    let y = 3;
    return x + y;
  }
  
  let result = getNine();
  console.log(result);  //9


//Debugging: Catch Arguments Passed in the Wrong Order When Calling a Function
/*Continuing the discussion on calling functions, the next bug to watch out for is when
 a function's arguments are supplied in the incorrect order. */

 function raiseToPower(b, e) {
    return Math.pow(b, e);
  }
  
  let base = 2;
  let exp = 3;
  let power = raiseToPower(base, exp); //fixed; raises a base to an exponent. 
  console.log(power);


//Debugging: Catch Off By One Errors When Using Indexing
/*Off by one errors (sometimes called OBOE) crop up when you're trying to target
 a specific index of a string or array (to slice or access a segment), or when
  looping over the indices of them. JavaScript indexing starts at zero, not one, 
  which means the last index is always one less than the length of the item. If you
   try to access an index equal to the length, the program may throw an 
   "index out of range" reference error or print undefined.

When you use string or array methods that take index ranges as arguments, 
it helps to read the documentation and understand if they are inclusive 
(the item at the given index is part of what's returned) or not. Here are some 
examples of off by one errors:  */

let alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
let len = alphabet.length;
for (let i = 0; i <= len; i++) {
  // loops one too many times at the end
  console.log(alphabet[i]);
}
for (let j = 1; j < len; j++) {
  // loops one too few times and misses the first character at index 0
  console.log(alphabet[j]);
}
for (let k = 0; k < len; k++) {
  // Goldilocks approves - this is just right
  console.log(alphabet[k]);
}
  


//Debugging: Use Caution When Reinitializing Variables Inside a Loop
/*Sometimes it's necessary to save information, increment counters, or re-set 
variables within a loop. A potential issue is when variables either should be 
reinitialized, and aren't, or vice versa. This is particularly dangerous if you 
accidentally reset the variable being used for the terminal condition, causing an 
infinite loop.

***Printing variable values with each cycle of your loop by using console.log() can 
uncover buggy behavior related to resetting, or failing to reset a variable.*** */



//Debugging: Prevent Infinite Loops with a Valid Terminal Condition
/*The final topic is the dreaded infinite loop. Loops are great tools when you need 
your program to run a code block a certain number of times or until a condition is met,
 but they need a terminal condition that ends the looping. Infinite loops are likely to 
 freeze or crash the browser, and cause general program execution mayhem, which no one wants.

There was an example of an infinite loop in the introduction to this section - it had no
 terminal condition to break out of the while loop inside loopy(). Do NOT call this function!

function loopy() {
  while(true) {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
  }
}
It's the programmer's job to ensure that the terminal condition, which tells the
 program when to break out of the loop code, is eventually reached.  */
