<!-- Applied Accessibility: Use tabindex to Add Keyboard Focus to an Element

The HTML tabindex attribute has three distinct functions relating to an element's keyboard focus. When it's on a tag, it indicates that element can be focused on. The value (an integer that's positive, negative, or zero) determines the behavior.

Certain elements, such as links and form controls, automatically receive keyboard focus when a user tabs through a page. It's in the same order as the elements come in the HTML source markup. This same functionality can be given to other elements, such as div, span, and p, by placing a tabindex="0" attribute on them. Here's an example:

<div tabindex="0">I need keyboard focus!</div>

Note: A negative tabindex value (typically -1) indicates that an element is focusable, but is not reachable by the keyboard.

Setting a tabindex="1" will bring keyboard focus to that element first. Then it cycles through the sequence of specified tabindex values (2, 3, etc.), before moving to default and tabindex="0" items.

It's important to note that when the tab order is set this way, it overrides the default order (which uses the HTML source). This may confuse users who are expecting to start navigation from the top of the page. This technique may be necessary in some circumstances, but in terms of accessibility, take care before applying it.

Here's an example:

<div tabindex="1">I get keyboard focus, and I get it first!</div>

<div tabindex="2">I get keyboard focus, and I get it second!</div>
