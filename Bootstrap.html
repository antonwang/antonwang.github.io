 <!-- Introduction to the Bootstrap Challenges -->
 <!-- Bootstrap is a front-end framework used to design responsive web pages and web applications. It takes a mobile-first approach to web development. Bootstrap includes pre-built CSS styles and classes, plus some JavaScript functionality. Bootstrap uses a responsive 12 column grid layout and has design templates for:
 
 buttons
 images
 tables
 forms
 navigation

<!-- Bootstrap: Use Responsive Design with Bootstrap Fluid Containers
In the HTML5 and CSS section of freeCodeCamp we built a Cat Photo App. Now let's go back 
to it. This time, we'll style it using the popular Bootstrap responsive CSS framework.

Bootstrap will figure out how wide your screen is and respond by resizing your HTML 
elements - hence the name responsive design.

With responsive design, there is no need to design a mobile version of your website. 
It will look good on devices with screens of any width.

You can add Bootstrap to any app by adding the following code to the top of your HTML:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"
 integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous"/>

In this case, we've already added it for you to this page behind the scenes. Note that 
using either > or /> to close the link tag is acceptable.

To get started, we should nest all of our HTML (except the link tag and the style element) 
in a div element with the class container-fluid. -->
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster, Monospace;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: Monospace;
  }

  .thick-green-border {
    border-color: green;
    border-width: 10px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }

  .smaller-image {
    width: 100px;
  }
</style>

<div class ="container-fluid">
<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Click here for <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

<a href="#"><img class="smaller-image thick-green-border" src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

<form action="/submit-cat-photo">
  <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label>
  <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label>

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
</div>

<!-- Bootstrap: Make Images Mobile Responsive
First, add a new image below the existing one. Set its src attribute to 
https://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats.

It would be great if this image could be exactly the width of our phone's screen.

Fortunately, with Bootstrap, all we need to do is add the img-responsive class to your
image. Do this, and the image should perfectly fit the width of your page. -->

<a href="#"><img class="img-responsive" src ="https://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats" 
    alt="three cats"></a>


<!-- Bootstrap: Center Text with Bootstrap
Now that we're using Bootstrap, we can center our heading element to make it look better. 
All we need to do is add the class text-center to our h2 element.

Remember that you can add several classes to the same element by separating each of them
with a space, like this: -->

<h2 class="red-text text-center">your text</h2> 

<!-- Bootstrap: Create a Bootstrap Button
Bootstrap has its own styles for button elements, which look much better than 
the plain HTML ones.

Create a new button element below your large kitten photo. Give it the btn and 
btn-default classes, as well as the text of "Like". -->

<button class="btn btn-default">Like</button> 




<!-- Bootstrap: Create a Block Element Bootstrap Button
Normally, your button elements with the btn and btn-default classes are only as wide as 
the text that they contain. For example:
 -->
<button class="btn btn-default">Submit</button>

<!-- This button would only be as wide as the word "Submit".

By making them block elements with the additional class of btn-block, your button will 
stretch to fill your page's entire horizontal space and any elements following it will 
flow onto a "new line" below the block. -->

<button class="btn btn-default btn-block">Submit</button>

<!-- 
This button would take up 100% of the available width.

Note that these buttons still need the btn class.

Add Bootstrap's btn-block class to your Bootstrap button. -->

<button class="btn btn-default btn-block">Like</button>
