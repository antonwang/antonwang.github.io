<!--Media Queries consist of a media type, and if that media type matches the type of device the document is displayed on, the styles are applied. You can have as many selectors and styles inside your media query as you want.

Here's an example of a media query that returns the content when the device's width is less than or equal to 100px:

@media (max-width: 100px) { /* CSS Rules */ }

and the following media query returns the content when the device's height is more than or equal to 350px:

@media (min-height: 350px) { /* CSS Rules */ }

Remember, the CSS inside the media query is applied only if the media type matches that of the device being used. -->
<style>
  p {
    font-size: 20px;
  }

  /* Add media query below */
  @media(max-height: 800px) {
    p { font-size: 10px}
  }

  img {
    max-width: 100%;
    display: block;
    height: auto;
} /*The max-width property of 100% scales the image to fit the width of its container, but the image won't stretch wider than its original width. Setting the display property to block changes the image from an inline element (its default), to a block element on its own line. The height property of auto keeps the original aspect ratio of the image.

Due to the difference in pixel density between a "Retina" and "Non-Retina" displays, some images that have not been made with a High-Resolution Display in mind could look "pixelated" when rendered on a High-Resolution display.  

The simplest way to make your images properly appear on High-Resolution Displays, such as the MacBook Pros "retina display" is to define their width and height values as only half of what the original file is. */

h2 {width: 80vw;}
p {width: 75vmin;}

Responsive Web Design Principles: Make Typography Responsive
Instead of using em or px to size text, you can use viewport units for responsive typography. Viewport units, like percentages, are relative units, but they are based off different items. Viewport units are relative to the viewport dimensions (width or height) of a device, and percentages are relative to the size of the parent container element.

The four different viewport units are:

vw (viewport width): 10vw would be 10% of the viewport's width.
vh (viewport height): 3vh would be 3% of the viewport's height.
vmin (viewport minimum): 70vmin would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height or width).
vmax (viewport maximum): 100vmax would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension (height or width).
Here is an example that sets a body tag to 30% of the viewport's width.

body { width: 30vw; } */
</style>
