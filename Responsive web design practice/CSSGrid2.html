CSS Grid: Divide the Grid Into an Area Template

You can group cells of your grid together into an area and give the area a custom name. Do this by using grid-template-areas on the container like this:

grid-template-areas:
  "header header header"
  "advert content content"
  "footer footer footer";

The code above merges the top three cells together into an area named header, the bottom three cells into a footer area, and it makes two areas in the middle row; advert and content. Note: Every word in the code represents a cell and every pair of quotation marks represent a row. In addition to custom labels, you can use a period (.) to designate an empty cell in the grid.-->

<style>
  .item1{background:LightSkyBlue;}
  .item2{background:LightSalmon;}
  .item3{background:PaleTurquoise;}
  .item4{background:LightPink;}

  .item5 {
    background: PaleGreen;
   

    grid-area: footer;
    /* This lets the grid know that you want the item1 class to go in the area named header. In this case, the item will use the entire top row because that whole row is named as the header area. */
  }

  .container {
    font-size: 40px;
    min-height: 300px;
    width: 100%;
    background: LightGray;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
    grid-gap: 10px;
    grid-template-areas:
      "header header header"
      "advert content content"
      "footer footer footer";
  }
</style>

<div class="container">
  <div class="item1">1</div>
  <div class="item2">2</div>
  <div class="item3">3</div>
  <div class="item4">4</div>
  <div class="item5">5</div>
</div>

<!-- The grid-area property you learned in the last challenge can be used in another way. If your grid doesn't have an areas template to reference, you can create an area on the fly for an item to be placed like this:

item1 { grid-area: 1/1/2/4; }

This is using the line numbers you learned about earlier to define where the area for this item will be. The numbers in the example above represent these values:

grid-area: horizontal line to start at / vertical line to start at / horizontal line to end at / vertical line to end at;

So the item in the example will consume the rows between lines 1 and 2, and the columns between lines 1 and 4.




CSS Grid: Reduce Repetition Using the repeat Function

Here's an example that would create the 100 row grid, each row at 50px tall.

grid-template-rows: repeat(100, 50px);
You can also repeat multiple values with the repeat function and insert the function amongst other values when defining a grid structure. Here's what that looks like:

grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr 50px) 20px;
This translates to:

grid-template-columns: 1fr 50px 1fr 50px 20px;
Note: The 1fr 50px is repeated twice followed by 20px.
