Applied Accessibility: Add a Text Alternative to Images for Visually Impaired Accessibility

Applied Accessibility: Make Screen Reader Navigation Easier with the header, nav, footer Landmarks   etc

<!-- People with visual impairments rely on screen readers to convert web content to an audio interface. They won't get information if it's only presented visually. For images, screen readers can access the alt attribute and read its contents to deliver key information.

Good alt text provides the reader a brief description of the image. You should always include an alt attribute on your image. Per HTML5 specification, this is now considered mandatory. -->

<img src="visualDecoration.jpeg" alt="">
<!-- 
In situations when an image is already explained with text content, or does not add meaning to a page, the img still needs an alt attribute, but it can be set to an empty string. 

Note: For images with a caption, you may still want to include alt text, since it helps search engines catalog the content of the image.
-->


<!-- Headings (h1 through h6 elements) are workhorse tags that help provide structure and labeling to your content. Screen readers can be set to read only the headings on a page so the user gets a summary. This means it is important for the heading tags in your markup to have semantic meaning and relate to each other, not be picked merely for their size values.

Semantic meaning means that the tag you use around content indicates the type of information it contains.


One final point, each page should always have one (and only one) h1 element, which is the main subject of your content. This and the other headings are used in part by search engines to understand the topic of the page.

The main element is used to wrap (you guessed it) the main content, and there should be only one per page. It's meant to surround the information that's related to the central topic of your page. It's not meant to include items that repeat across pages, like navigation links or banners.

The main tag also has an embedded landmark feature that assistive technology can use to quickly navigate to the main content. If you've ever seen a "Jump to Main Content" link at the top of a page, using a main tag automatically gives assistive devices that functionality.

</style>   <!--The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) recommend at least a 4.5 to 1 contrast ratio for normal text. The ratio is calculated by comparing the relative luminance values of two colors. This ranges from 1:1 for the same color, or no contrast, to 21:1 for white against black, the strongest contrast.  -->

<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Training with Camper Cat</h1>
 <!--  header tag is used to wrap introductory information or navigation links for its parent tag and works well around content that's repeated at the top on multiple pages.

Note: The header is meant for use in the body tag of your HTML document. This is different than the head element, which contains the page's title, meta information, etc.	-->

  </audio>
  <!--  HTML5's audio element gives semantic meaning when it wraps sound or audio stream content in your markup. Audio content also needs a text alternative to be accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. This can be done with nearby text on the page or a link to a transcript.
	
The audio tag supports the controls attribute. This shows the browser default play, pause, and other controls, and supports keyboard functionality. This is a boolean attribute, meaning it doesn't need a value, its presence on the tag turns the setting on.-->

	<!-- The label tag wraps the text for a specific form control item, usually the name or label for a choice. This ties meaning to the item and makes the form more readable. The for attribute on a label tag explicitly associates that label with the form control and is used by screen readers. -->

This is an inline element that can wrap a date or time on a page. datetime attribute is the value accessed by assistive devices. It helps avoid confusion by stating a standardized version of a time, even if it's written in an informal or colloquial manner in the text.-->

This happens when information is in a visual format (like a chart), but screen reader users need an alternative presentation (like a table) to access the data.
