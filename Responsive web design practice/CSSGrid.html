CSS Grid helps you easily build complex web designs. It works by turning an HTML element into a grid container with rows and columns for you to place children elements where you want within the grid. -->

<style>
  .d1{background:LightSkyBlue;}
  .d2{background:LightSalmon;}
  .d3{background:PaleTurquoise;}
  .d4{background:LightPink;}
  .d5{background:PaleGreen;}

  .container {
    font-size: 40px;
    width: 100%;
    background: LightGray;
    display: grid; /* 

Turn any HTML element into a grid container by setting its display property to grid. This gives you the ability to use all the other properties associated with CSS Grid.

Note: In CSS Grid, the parent element is referred to as the container and its children are called items.*/

    grid-template-columns: 100px 100px 100px; 

/* Simply creating a grid element doesn't get you very far. You need to define the structure of the grid as well. To add some columns to the grid, use the grid-template-columns property on a grid container

This will give your grid three columns that are each 100px wide. The number of parameters given to the grid-template-columns property indicates the number of columns in the grid, and the value of each parameter indicates the width of each column.

You can use absolute and relative units like px and em in CSS Grid to define the size of rows and columns. You can use these as well:

	fr: sets the column or row to a fraction of the available space,

	auto: sets the column or row to the width or height of its content automatically,

	%: adjusts the column or row to the percent width of its container. */

		grid-template-columns: auto 50px 10% 2fr 1fr;
    
/* This snippet creates five columns. The first column is as wide as its content, the second column is 50px, the third column is 10% of its container, and for the last two columns; the remaining space is divided into three sections, two are allocated for the fourth column, and one for the fifth.	*/

    grid-template-rows: 50px 50px;

/*The grid you created in the last challenge will set the number of rows automatically. To adjust the rows manually, use the grid-template-rows property in the same way you used grid-template-columns in previous challenge.*/

    grid-column-gap: 20px;

/* So far in the grids you have created, the columns have all been tight up against each other. Sometimes you want a gap in between the columns. To add a gap between the columns, use the grid-column-gap property. This creates 20px of empty space between all of our columns. */

    grid-row-gap: 5px;

    grid-gap: 5px 20px;

/* grid-gap is a shorthand property for grid-row-gap and grid-column-gap from the previous two challenges that's more convenient to use. 

If grid-gap has one value, it will create a gap between all rows and columns. 

However, if there are two values, it will use the first one to set the gap between the rows and the second value for the columns. */

start: aligns the content at the left of the cell,

center: aligns the content in the center of the cell,
